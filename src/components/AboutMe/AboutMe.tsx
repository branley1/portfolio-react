    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      I'm a senior at Swarthmore College majoring in Computer Science with a
      Cognitive Science minor. I specialize in full-stack development, machine
      learning, and Artificial Intelligence, with a passion for creating
      innovative, user-focused solutions.
    </p>
    <p>
      I'm a software engineer with a strong foundation in full-stack
      development, and scalable system design. I've specialized in building
      solutions with tools such as React.js, Node.js, and TensorFlow, and I'm
      proficient in several languages including Python, C, C++, Swift, GoLang,
      and TypeScript.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fascinated by the intersection of technology and creativity, my interests
      span music, film (animations), 3D development, and human-computer
      interaction. My work emphasizes AI/ML, natural language processing (NLP),
      computational linguistics, and full-stack development.
    </p>

    <p>
      I'm particularly passionate about using NLP to uncover implicit knowledge
      in large text collections and applying it to build human-centered
      applications. My goal is to enhance human-computer interactions by
      bridging the gap between machines and humans for more intuitive and
      meaningful connections.
