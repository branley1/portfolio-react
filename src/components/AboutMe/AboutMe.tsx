    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      I'm a software engineer with a strong foundation in machine learning,
      full-stack development, and scalable system design. I specialize in
      building solutions with tools like React.js, Node.js, and TensorFlow, and
      I'm proficient in several languages including Python, C, C++, Swift,
      GoLang, and TypeScript.
    </p>
    <p>
      My experience spans developing efficient REST APIs, leveraging frameworks
      like PyTorch and SwiftUI, and managing databases such as PostgreSQL and
      MongoDB. I enjoy tackling complex problems, whether it's optimizing ML
      models or designing high-performance architectures.
    </p>
    <p>
      With a technical background rooted in algorithms, AI, and software
      engineering, I bring both depth and adaptability to my work. I'm always
      eager to learn, improve, and contribute to meaningful projects that push
      boundaries.
