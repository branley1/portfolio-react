    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      I'm a senior at Swarthmore College, majoring in Computer Science with a
      Cognitive Science minor. I specialize in full-stack development, machine
      learning, and artificial intelligence, with a passion for creating
      innovative, user-focused solutions that make a real impact.
    </p>
    <p>
      As a software engineer, I have a strong foundation in scalable system
      design and full-stack development. I've built solutions using tools like
      React.js, Node.js, and TensorFlow, and I'm proficient in several
      programming languages, including Python, C++, Swift, Go, and TypeScript.
    </p>
    <p>
      I'm deeply fascinated by the intersection of technology and creativity. My
      interests span music, film (animations), 3D development, and
      human-computer interaction, inspiring me to explore how technology can
      enhance artistic expression and user experiences. My work often focuses on
      AI/ML, natural language processing (NLP), computational linguistics, and
      full-stack applications.
    </p>

    <p>
      I'm particularly passionate about using NLP to uncover hidden patterns and
      knowledge within large text datasets and applying these insights to create
      human-centered applications. My ultimate goal is to enhance human-computer
      interactions by bridging the gap between machines and humans, fostering
      more intuitive and meaningful connections.
